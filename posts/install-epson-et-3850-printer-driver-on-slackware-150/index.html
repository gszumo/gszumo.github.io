    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-100-l"><p>I recently bought an <em>Epson ET-3850</em> printer from <em>Costco</em> to replace my <em>HP OfficeJet</em> which was about 10 years old and the family was starting to have issues with establishing a wi-fi connection to it on their Windoze laptops. It took quite a while to setup. The <em>Epson</em> seems to be doing the job. Time will tell, however I discovered that setting it up for <em>Slackware</em> would also take a bit of effort. Drivers are only available on the <em>Epson</em> website in <em>RPM</em> or <em>DEB</em> format so I had to create a <em>Slackware</em> package to install it. Here&rsquo;s how I went about doing that.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, download the <em>RPM</em> package from the <a href="https://epson.com/Support/wa00821">Epson Support website</a>.</li>
<li>Convert the <em>RPM</em> to a <em>Slackware</em> <code>.txz</code> package using the <code>rpm2txz</code> utility with the following options:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>-c</code>: to make sure the file permissions are set correctly</li>
<li><code>-S</code>: to extract the install scripts from the <em>RPM</em> (be careful with this)</li>
<li><code>-n</code>: name the package using standard <em>Slackware</em> format</li>
<li><code>-d</code>: make a <em>slack-desc</em> from the <em>RPM</em>&rsquo;s metadata</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code># rpm2txz -c -S -n -d epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-1.2.4-1.x86_64.rpm</code><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now review the script. Make any changes, if necessary (I didn&rsquo;t need to), and update the converted package:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code># mkdir temp &amp;&amp; cd temp</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code># explodepkg ../epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-1.2.4-x86_64-1.txz </code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code># makepkg -l y -c y ../epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-1.2.4-x86_64-1.txz </code><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once that is done you can install it:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code># cd ..</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code># installpkg epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2-1.2.4-x86_64-1.txz </code><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The printer did not show up as available to install in the &ldquo;<em>System Settings</em>&rdquo; app so go to the local <em>CUPS</em> webpage at <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a> and do the setup from there. Print a few test pages. It seems to be working fine on my <em>Slackware</em> laptop. You can move the package to your other <em>Slackware</em> machines and install there too.</p>
