Supports Markdown
Is cross-platform
Supports vim keyboard mappings (I can&rsquo;t live without this)
Integrates with multiple cloud storage environments.

I use it on a daily basis for almost all of my notes but it also supports checklists on my iPhone, iPad, Windoze laptop, and all of my Slackware devices (desktop and laptops). Give it a try!">

<ul>
<li>Supports Markdown</li>

<p>I use it on a daily basis for almost all of my notes but it also supports checklists on my iPhone, iPad, Windoze laptop, and all of my Slackware devices (desktop and laptops). Give it a try!</p>
<p>As of yet, it is not available as a SlackBuild, but you can install it on Slackware quite easily using the CLI with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>$ wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/dev/Joplin_install_and_update.sh | bash </code><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
