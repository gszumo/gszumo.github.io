    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-100-l"><p>I was having issues finding a good voice synthesis for Foliate to read my books to me. I have always had issues with the sound of the <code>espeak</code> and <code>espeak-ng</code> voices. So I was searching for an alternative. I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to build <code>festival</code> on Slackware (yet) but while searching around found a package called <code>svox</code> that had a SlackBuild so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>svox</code> SlackBuild package using whatever tools you would normally use. I happen to use <code>sbotools</code> which make use of the packages maintained by Ponce.</li>
<li>You will end up with a binary called <code>pico2audio</code> which is the program you need to perform all of your text-to-speech needs. See <code>pico2audio --help</code> for details (there aren&rsquo;t really many).</li>
</ol>
<p>It was simpler than I thought. Just open Foliate, Settings (the hamburger menu), Preferences and then enter <code>pico2audio</code> in the <code>Text-to-Speech Command</code> box and you&rsquo;re done.</p>
