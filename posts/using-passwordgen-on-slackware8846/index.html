<p>If you go to their <a href="https://ss64.com/pass/command-line.html">command line</a> section you can use the link to their GitHub site and download it for yourself. However, when I followed their installation instructions I ran into difficulty because the script has a dependency on <code>pbcopy</code> or <code>gclip</code> (which wasn&rsquo;t documented) and since I run Slackware 15.0 the copy to clipboard feature failed.</p>
<p>The workaround for this is to install either <code>xclip</code> or <code>xsel</code> from <em>Slackbuilds.org</em> and make a minor modification to the script as described here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>22c22,23</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>&lt;     which gclip pbcopy | grep -v -m 1 'not found'</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>---</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>&gt;     which xclip xsel | grep -v -m 1 'not found'</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>&gt; </code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>52c53</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>&lt;             ss64pwd_to_clipboard $one_arg</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
