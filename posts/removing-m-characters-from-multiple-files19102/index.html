<p>solves the problem, but on occasion I might be confronted with performing this process on multiple files and sometimes recursively through many subdirectories. When that happens it becomes necessary to bring out the &ldquo;big guns&rdquo; and do:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> $ for file in $(find /path/to/dir -type f); do <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->       tr -d &lsquo;\r&rsquo; &lt;$file &gt;temp.$$ &amp;&amp; mv temp.$$ $file <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>(BTW, to generate a ^M character using the PuTTY emulator is easy. Just press CTRL-^ followed by CTRL-M)</p>
<p>Of course, in Linux, UNIX and AIX shells there are many ways to skin a cat and this is just one of many possible solutions. This solution was found on <a href="https://dailyvim.blogspot.com">a Daily Vim Blogspot site</a> which has more very interesting tips &amp; tutorials.</p>
