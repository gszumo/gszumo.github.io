<p>There are 4 classes of IPv4 networks:</p>
<p>A <em>Class A network</em> can have 16,777,214 computers on it. It
has an IP address that starts with a number in the range 0 to 126. 127
is reserved for the local loopback. (Only 127.0.0.1 is ever used
although this may change in the future).</p>
<p>A <em>Class B</em> network can have 65,534 computers on it. It has an
IP address that starts in the range of 128 to 191.</p>
<p>A <em>Class C</em> network can have 254 computers on it. This network
is often used for many home networks and most company networks. It has
an IP address that starts with a number from 192 to 223.</p>
<p><em>Class D</em> (224–239) is used for multicast and Class E
(240–254) is reserved.</p>
<p>Within the above classes are sets of private network addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any address that starts with 10</li>
<li>Any address that starts 172 and where the second number is
16–31.</li>
<li>Any address that starts with 192.168</li>
</ul>
<p>Routers will generally discard any traffic to private network
addresses. So,in order to talk to other devices, your router does
something called Network Address Translation or NATtin. You can read
more about Network Address Translation and how it works <a
